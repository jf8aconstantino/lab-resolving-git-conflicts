I am Jorge Ochoa
I am From Tuxtla Gtz Chiapas, but I have lived in Monterrey the last 8 years
I am automation Engineer and currently I work at projects/maintenance department at a manufacturing plant

I am here because codification is a topic that O have not studied before as it seems so difficult but at the same time it is very interesting for me 

I got to know Ironhack thanks to a peer that took data analysis course a year ago
I'd like to learn python codification, of course all the tools that helps to know data in a deeper way

After completing bootcamp, i'd like to start working as data analyst whether to be in the same company where I currently work or another one

I look forward to be transfered to data analysis or ML team at my current company or to be hired by a global company with DA, ML and AI projects

my future role look like being analysing data, getting insights and giving inputs to improve processes
My career goal is to be a Project Mgr, and why not to start up a company
